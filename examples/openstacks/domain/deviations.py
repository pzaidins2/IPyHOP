File Description: Openstacks deviations file. All the deviations for Openstack planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: https://github.com/shop-planner/plan-repair-icaps2020-htnws/blob/master/problems/openstacks/deviation-operators.lisp

Each IPyHOP action is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state, and the others are the planning
action's usual arguments. This is analogous to how methods are defined for Python classes (where the first argument
is the class instance). For example, the function "a_pickup(state, b)" implements the planning action for the
task ('a_pickup', b).
