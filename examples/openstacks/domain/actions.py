File Description: Openstacks (Propositional) actions file. All the actions for Openstacks planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: https://github.com/shop-planner/plan-repair-icaps2020-htnws/blob/master/problems/openstacks/domain.lisp

Each IPyHOP action is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state, and the others are the planning
action's usual arguments. This is analogous to how methods are defined for Python classes (where the first argument
is the class instance). For example, the function "a_pickup(state, b)" implements the planning action for the
task ('a_pickup', b).

The state is described with following properties:
- rigid = dict of properties that should not change
    - type_dict = dict with types as keys and sets of all objects of the corresponding type as values
    - includes = dict with orders as keys and set of products needed as values
    - included_in = inverse of includes such that o in included_in[ next( iter( includes[ o ] ) ) ]
    - max_stacks = int for max allowable number of maximum stacks
- made = dict with products as keys and boolean value representing whether product has been made
- busy = boolean value that is True when product in production else False
- making = dict with products as keys and bool indicating whether product is in production as values
- started = dict with orders as keys and bool indicating whether order has open stack as values
- delivered = dict with ( order, product ) as keys and bool representing whether product has been delivered for order as values
- stacks_open = int for number of current open stacks
- shipped = dict with orders as keys and bool indicating whether the order has shipped as values
- waiting = dict with orders as keys and bool indicating whether the order is waiting as values
