File Description: Openstacks methods file. All the methods for Openstacks planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: PyHOP example of Openstacks domain variant as described https://ipg.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/challenge/#challenge
specifcally the sequenced strips ADL no-cost variant

Each IPyHOP method is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state (this is analogous to Python methods,
in which the first argument is the class instance). The rest of the arguments must match the arguments of the
task that the method is for. For example, the task ('get', b1) has a method "tm_get(state, b1)", as shown below.
