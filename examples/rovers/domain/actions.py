File Description: Roversactions file. All the actions for Rovers planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: https://github.com/shop-planner/plan-repair-icaps2020-htnws/blob/master/problems/rovers/domain.pddl

Each IPyHOP action is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state, and the others are the planning
action's usual arguments. This is analogous to how methods are defined for Python classes (where the first argument
is the class instance). For example, the function "a_pickup(state, b)" implements the planning action for the
task ('a_pickup', b).

The state is described with following properties:
- rigid = dict of properties that should not change
    - type_dict = dict with types as keys and sets of all objects of the corresponding type as values
    - equipped_for_soil_analysis = dict with rover as key and bool value
    - equipped_for_rock_analysis = dict with rover as key and bool value
    - equipped_for_imaging = dict with rover as key and bool value
    - supports = dict with camera as key and set of modes as value
    - visible = dict with waypoint as key and set of waypoints as value

    - store_of = dict with store as key and rover as value
    - has_store = dict with rover as key and store as value
    - calibration_target = dict with camera as key and objective as value
    - on_board = dict with camera as key and rover as value
    - carries = dict with rover as key and set of cameras on_board as value
    - at_lander = dict with lander as key and the location waypoint as value
    - can_traverse = dict with rover as key and set of ( waypoint, waypoint ) as value
- at = dict with rover as key and the location waypoint as value

- empty = set of empty stores
- have_rock_analysis = dict with rover as key and set of waypoints at value
- have_soil_analysis = dict with rover as key and set of waypoints at value
- full = set of full stores
- calibrated = dict with ( camera, rover ) key and bool value
- available = set of available rovers Note: doesn't appear to be used
- have_image = dict with rover as key and set of ( objective, mode ) as value
- communicated_soil_data = dict with waypoint as key and bool value
- communicated_rock_data = dict with waypoint as key and bool value
- communicated_image_data = dict with ( waypoint, mode ) as key and bool value
- at_soil_sample = dict with waypoint as key and bool value
- at_rock_sample = dict with waypoint as key and bool value
- channel_free = dict with lander as key and bool as value
- visible_from = dict with objective as key and set of waypoints as value (deviations modify this)
