File Description: Satellite actions file. All the actions for Satellite planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: https://github.com/shop-planner/plan-repair-icaps2020-htnws/blob/master/problems/satellite/adlSat-pure.lisp

Each IPyHOP action is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state, and the others are the planning
action's usual arguments. This is analogous to how methods are defined for Python classes (where the first argument
is the class instance). For example, the function "a_pickup(state, b)" implements the planning action for the
task ('a_pickup', b).

The state is described with following properties:
- rigid = dict of properties that should not change
    - type_dict = dict with types as keys and sets of all objects of the corresponding type as values
    - on_board = dict with satellites as keys and set of on board instrument as values
    - calibration_target = dict with instrument as key and direction for calibration as value
    - supports = dict with instrument as key and set of supported modes as value
- pointing = dict with satellite as key and diretion pointing as value
- power_avail = dict with satellite as key and bool indicating whether power is available as value
- power_on = dict with instrument as key and bool indicating whether instrument is turn on
- calibrated = dict with instrument as key and bool indicating whether instrument is calibrated
- have_image = dict with ( direction, mode ) as key and bool representing whether image has been taken as value
