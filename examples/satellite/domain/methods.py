File Description: Satellite methods file. All the methods for Satellite planning domain are defined here.
Derived from: https://github.com/shop-planner/plan-repair-icaps2020-htnws/blob/master/problems/satellite/adlSat-pure.lisp

Each IPyHOP method is a Python function. The 1st argument is the current state (this is analogous to Python methods,
in which the first argument is the class instance). The rest of the arguments must match the arguments of the
task that the method is for. For example, the task ('get', b1) has a method "tm_get(state, b1)", as shown below.
